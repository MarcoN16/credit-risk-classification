# credit-risk-classification

In this project, various techniques were employed to train and evaluate a model for assessing loan risk. Leveraging a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, a model was developed to discern the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
The initial step involved importing the lending_data.csv dataset from the resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame. Subsequently, a labels set (y) was created from the “loan_status” column, while the features (X) DataFrame was extracted from the remaining columns. Upon examining the value counts of the label set, it became evident that there was a significant imbalance between class labels (class 0 = 75036; class 1 = 2500). To mitigate the bias towards the majority class in logistic regression, which may lead to poor detection of the minority class and misleading metrics, resampling techniques were employed to balance the dataset. The data were then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

## Create a Logistic Regression Model
A logistic regression model was trained using the training data (X_train and y_train). Subsequently, predictions were made on the testing data labels using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. Model performance was evaluated by generating a confusion matrix and a classification report.

## Conclusions
The analysis aimed to create a model for assessing loan risk, utilizing a dataset of historical lending activity. A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column indicates a healthy loan, while a value of 1 signifies a high risk of default. The classification report demonstrated high accuracy of 100% on the test data (n=1250). The confusion matrix indicated:
-	True positive: 625
-	False positive: 4
-	False negative: 0
-	True negative: 621

Calculation of precision, recall, and accuracy revealed superior performance by the model:
-	Precision to identify status = 0 is 99% and status = 1 is 100%, indicating lower misclassification of false positives.
-	Recall to identify status = 0 is  100% and status = 1 is 99%, indicating lower misclassification of false negatives.

The model exhibited strong performance in discriminating the creditworthiness of borrowers. However, caution is warranted as the results may appear too good to be true. Employing various machine learning algorithms and validation analyses, including equalizing sample sizes of the two loan statuses, reinforced the model's reliability for predicting borrower creditworthiness with high accuracy. Nevertheless, continuous testing of new data and a focus on mitigating misclassifications, particularly regarding loans at high risk of default, are essential precautionary measures to minimize potential adverse impacts resulting from incorrect classifications.
